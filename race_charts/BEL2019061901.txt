EVAN'S NICE NOW away without apparent mishap, was in reserve pressing the issue from the two path, was yet being held

snatching away the advantage as the field turned into the stretch, came under a ride approximately a sixteenth down the road,

scampered away to a comfortable lead before getting wrapped up in the final forty yards. BIG BENNYS TRIBUTE inched her way to

rail after bobbling at the break, getting there by the conclusion of the backstretch, eyed the front runners under patient handling,

angled three wide into the stretch and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, came out a couple of paths under a steady left

handed whip, yet flashed belated energy nevertheless garnering the place. IT'S A SHAW THING put to a brisk hand springing from

the gate, out-broke the others by a length, was soon joined by the winner, raced as a team with that rival, was displaced on the

front end despite having gotten set down at the quarter pole, steadily backed away. BID YOU ADIEU underwent a two to three

wide pursuit on the turn, swung four wide into the lane, had no offering. RAMBLIN' MA'AM hung out three to four wide, was set

down coming up to the quarter pole, gave way.
